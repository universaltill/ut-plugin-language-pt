# Ratcheting key-parity guard against core's base locale (ut-docs#292).
#
# WHY A RATCHET, NOT A HARDCODED "pt.json == en.json": ADR-0010 makes a
# language pack an asset-only overlay -- core's T() falls back pt -> en on a
# missing key, so an untranslated key degrades gracefully to English rather
# than breaking the till, which means a temporary gap (core ships a key
# today, this pack translates it next week) is a legitimate, trackable
# state, not automatically a bug. So the check is not a literal file-equality
# assertion; it's "the untranslated set today is EXACTLY the untranslated
# set the baseline file says we already know about, no more, no less" --
# PLUS: every key pt.json claims to translate must actually carry a real,
# non-empty, actually-Portuguese value (see "value checks" below), because a key
# present in pt.json is not by itself evidence of a translation.
#
# EXACT PARITY, ENFORCED (ut-docs#297): as of the 2026-08 translation pass,
# the baseline is 0 entries -- pt.json covers every core key. That makes the
# ratchet's existing behavior into a de facto exact-parity check already
# (with an empty baseline, ANY newly-missing key is unconditionally
# "not in the baseline" = new drift = FAIL; see the missing/new_drift logic
# below, unchanged). What's added here so that isn't just an accident of the
# current state: `--update-baseline` (the one command that can reopen debt)
# now REFUSES to grow an empty baseline unless the caller also passes
# `--allow-growth`. Regressing from 100% coverage back into ratchet mode is
# still possible -- core will keep adding keys this pack won't always
# translate same-day -- but it now takes a second, explicitly-named flag,
# not just re-running the normal update command out of habit.
#
# What actually broke in #292: core shipped 6 new pfand.* keys and this
# pack was never updated, so a Portuguese till silently rendered English
# ("Deposit refund" instead of "Pfandrückgabe") -- ADR-0010's fallback
# masked the gap instead of surfacing it. Nothing failed anywhere. This
# script is what should have caught that: any NEW gap between core and
# pt.json that isn't already accounted for in the baseline is drift, and
# drift fails CI loudly instead of shipping silently.
#
# The baseline (i18n-baseline/pt.untranslated.txt) tracks known-accepted
# gaps:
#   - a core key with no pt.json translation is fine IFF it's already
#     listed in the baseline (known, accepted debt);
#   - a core key with no pt.json translation that is NOT in the baseline
#     is new drift -- FAIL (this is what would have caught #292);
#   - a baseline entry that HAS since been translated is a stale baseline
#     entry -- FAIL (forces pruning, so the baseline can never quietly
#     grow stale and hide a real re-regression later);
#   - a baseline entry core no longer has is also stale -- FAIL, prune it;
#   - a pt.json key core doesn't have at all is an orphan -- FAIL always,
#     no baseline exception (a pack has no business inventing base keys).
# This set cannot grow SILENTLY: it can only grow through a deliberate,
# reviewed edit to the baseline file itself, which shows up in the diff.
# That is not the same claim as "only shrinks" -- adding a key on purpose
# is the documented escape hatch, not a violation of the guard.
#
# VALUE CHECKS (the part key-set comparison alone misses): a key can be
# *present* in pt.json and still not be a real translation --
#   - empty / whitespace-only value -- FAIL always. Core's T() returns
#     whatever pt.json has unconditionally, so an empty value renders
#     blank UI in production, which is worse than the English fallback a
#     missing key would have produced.
#   - value byte-identical to core's English value -- FAIL, UNLESS the key
#     is listed in the same-as-English allowlist
#     (i18n-baseline/pt.same-as-en.txt) for strings that are legitimately
#     identical in both languages (brand names, "Online", "GitHub", ...).
#     This is the literal ut-docs#292 bug: "pfand.action": "Deposit
#     refund" is present, non-empty, and would pass a key-set-only check.
#   - the allowlist has the same staleness rule as the baseline: an entry
#     that is no longer byte-identical (translated since, or core's string
#     changed) or whose key no longer exists must FAIL so it gets pruned.
#   - placeholder token mismatch (ut-docs#297, hardened ut-docs#1865): for
#     every key present on both sides, the ORDERED list of printf verbs
#     (%s / %d / %g / ...) extracted from core's value must equal the list
#     extracted from pt.json's value, UNLESS both sides use Go's explicit
#     positional verbs (%[1]s, ...) exclusively, in which case they are
#     compared by explicit index instead of writing order -- see
#     verbs_match's own comment for the full reasoning. Template tokens
#     ({{name}}, {0}) are a separate dialect, always compared in order
#     regardless of what the printf side is doing. A dropped or invented
#     token renders a broken string in production; a REORDERED pair
#     without declaring it positionally is just as wrong -- positional
#     formatting feeds arguments in call order, so a swapped %s/%d prints
#     the values in the wrong slots even though both sides have the same
#     token count. Also covers the COUNT of literal %% occurrences
#     (ut-docs#1873): verb_tokens() discards %% as "not a verb" (correctly
#     -- it never consumes an argument), so a translator dropping one of a
#     pair's `%` characters ("50%% off" -> "50% off") shifts what the
#     following real verb parses as to Go's fmt parser without changing
#     the extracted verb-token list at all, and shipped green before this
#     count check existed.
#
# DUPLICATE KEYS (ut-docs#1872): a key defined twice in the same locale
# file is a HARD failure too, checked before anything else in load_json --
# plain json.load silently keeps only the last write, so a file with five
# duplicated keys (the real incident: two lanes each added the same five
# keys at a different point in the file, and git merged both additions
# with no conflict) parsed clean and every check above stayed green. See
# load_json's own comment for the detection mechanism.
#
# A missing/unreachable core source is a HARD failure, never a skip: a
# guard that quietly exits 0 when it can't fetch its own input is the
# exact silent-gap failure mode this script exists to close.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-key-drift.sh                 # run the check (default)
#   scripts/check-key-drift.sh --update-baseline    # rewrite the baseline
#   scripts/check-key-drift.sh --update-baseline --allow-growth  # ...even
#                                                    if that reopens debt on
#                                                    a baseline currently at
#                                                    full parity (ut-docs#297)
#   scripts/check-key-drift.sh --update-allowlist   # rewrite the allowlist
# Both --update-* flags resolve core's base locale exactly like the check
# does (UT_CORE_EN_JSON / UT_CORE_EN_URL / CORE_EN_URL below), so there is
# one single source of truth for "how do I find core's en.json" -- no
# hand-rolled comm/jq pipeline to keep in sync separately.
